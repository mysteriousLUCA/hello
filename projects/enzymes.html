            <h3 class="blog-title"><p>Key takeaway</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This research successfully isolated and characterized thermoacidophilic bacteria from Goan mangrove ecosystems, optimized cellulase production through response surface methodology, and demonstrated their potential for efficient lignocellulose degradation in sustainable biofuel production applications.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>Abstract</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marine mangrove environments represent unique ecosystems harboring extremophilic microorganisms with significant biotechnological potential. This study investigated the diversity of thermoacidophilic bacteria in Goan mangrove environments and characterized their lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for biofuel applications. Comprehensive sampling across 13 sites yielded 213 bacterial isolates, with 41 demonstrating cellulase activity and one exhibiting laccase production under thermoacido conditions. Response surface methodology (RSM) optimization identified strain M5 10 as the optimal producer, achieving maximum cellulase activity of 8.07 units at 55°C and pH 5.9. The research demonstrates the significant potential of marine extremophiles for sustainable enzyme production, addressing critical gaps in environmentally friendly lignocellulose bioprocessing technologies.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>Introduction</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, but its efficient conversion requires specialized enzymes capable of functioning under extreme industrial conditions. Marine environments, particularly mangrove ecosystems, harbor diverse microbial communities adapted to fluctuating conditions that may yield novel thermoacidophilic enzymes with industrial applications.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This research addresses the critical need for sustainable biofuel technologies by exploring the untapped potential of Goan mangrove ecosystems as sources of thermoacidophilic lignocellulolytic enzymes. The study's significance lies in its systematic approach to bioprospecting, isolation, and optimization of enzyme production from extremophilic bacteria capable of functioning under the harsh conditions required for industrial lignocellulose degradation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marine Extremophiles and Biotechnological Applications</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marine environments harbor diverse microorganisms adapted to extreme conditions including elevated temperatures, acidic pH, and high salinity. These organisms produce unique enzymes capable of functioning under extreme conditions, making them valuable for industrial biotechnology applications. Thermoacidophiles, which thrive at high temperatures (>45°C) and low pH (<3.5), are particularly relevant for biomass processing where harsh reaction conditions are often required.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lignocellulose Degradation and Biofuel Production</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lignocellulose represents the most abundant renewable biomass source on Earth, comprising cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin components. Efficient degradation requires multiple enzyme systems including cellulases, hemicellulases, and lignin-degrading enzymes operating under optimal temperature and pH conditions. Traditional approaches face limitations in enzyme stability, reaction efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, driving the need for robust extremophilic enzymes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mangrove Ecosystems as Microbial Reservoirs</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mangrove ecosystems present unique environmental conditions combining marine salinity with terrestrial organic matter, creating niches for diverse extremophilic communities. The fluctuating conditions in these environments select for microorganisms with remarkable enzymatic versatility. Despite their biotechnological potential, mangrove-derived extremophiles remain underexplored compared to terrestrial and deep-sea sources.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>Materials and Methods</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sample Collection and Site Selection</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Field sampling was conducted across 13 strategically selected sites throughout Goa's mangrove ecosystems. Sites included 10 living mangrove areas and 3 degraded mangrove zones, representing diverse environmental conditions. Water and sediment samples were collected in sterile 50 ml falcon tubes, with environmental parameters (pH, temperature, salinity) recorded at each location.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bacterial Isolation and Cultivation</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Samples were cultured on modified Nutrient Agar plates using water from collection sites. Pure cultures were obtained through quadrant streaking methodology and maintained under various extreme conditions. Growth conditions included normal (37°C, pH 7), thermoacido (50°C, pH 5), and other combinations to identify versatile strains.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Enzyme Screening Methodologies</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- Cellulase Detection: Gram's iodine flooding technique was employed on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plates. This method creates distinct clearance zones around cellulase-producing colonies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- Laccase Screening: Colonies were grown on Luria agar plates containing 0.65 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) for 7 days. Positive laccase activity was indicated by color change.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Optimization</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A Box-Behnken experimental design was implemented to optimize enzyme production conditions with cellulase activity as the response variable. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA to identify significant factors and interactions.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>Results and Discussion</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Environmental Sampling and Isolate Collection</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Comprehensive sampling across Goan mangrove sites yielded valuable insights into environmental diversity. Sites exhibited pH ranges from 3.5-7.9, temperatures from 28-38°C, and salinity from 10-65 ppt, reflecting the extreme environmental heterogeneity characteristic of mangrove ecosystems. A total of 213 bacterial isolates were successfully cultured, with isolate numbers varying from 7-28 per site depending on environmental conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Qualitative Enzyme Screening Results</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Qualitative screening revealed significant enzyme activity among mangrove isolates. Of 213 tested isolates, 41 (19.2%) demonstrated positive cellulase activity using the Gram's iodine CMC method, while only one isolate showed laccase production under thermoacido conditions. This distribution suggests that cellulase-producing thermoacidophiles are relatively common in mangrove environments, while laccase producers are rare.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Quantitative Enzyme Analysis and Standards</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Glucose standard curves demonstrated excellent linearity (R² > 0.95) across concentration ranges from 0.01-0.33 mg/mL. DNSA assay optimization confirmed reliable quantitative enzyme activity measurements with minimal variation between replicates. The DNSA methodology proved highly effective for cellulase quantification, with clear dose-response relationships observed across enzyme concentrations.</p>
