            <h2 class="blog-title">What is life?</h2>
            
            <h3 class="blog-title"><p>The Current Scientific Consensus</p></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, NASA narrowed the possible definition to one that can be called an elegant one: Life is a self-sustaining chemical system that can evolve Darwinianly. Decades of research are summarised by this succinct statement. Life cannot be entirely chemistry or entirely evolution; it is a man who is a combination of both elements at work. The definition does not focus on particular mechanistic information of either DNA or proteins and thus aims to maintain the plasticity to accommodate life forms yet to be discovered.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The self-sustaining feature points out that living systems have to sustain themselves by continuing a chemical process, which is usually called metabolism. This is not only the absorption of nutrients and breathing in and out of materials, but also the use of environmental energy to maintain order in a universe naturally inclined towards entropy.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Darwinian evolution element ensures that the system can evolve with time to adapt to the new circumstances through heritable variation and selection. In this evolutionary possibility, the system would be more of a complex chemistry than life itself.</p>
         
            <h3 class="blog-title"><p>The Seven Pillars of Biological Organization</p></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout my career, I've observed that all life on Earth, from bacteria to blue whales, shares seven fundamental characteristics. These aren't arbitrary categories but rather emergent properties that appear consistently across every living system we've studied.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;">
                <img src="../images/blog/life/life 1.gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-fit: cover;">
            </div>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Cellular organization</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The basis is established on cellular organisation. All the organisms we have observed have at least one cell, a unit marked by a membrane that divides the living structure from the environment. This compartmentalisation is essential- it provides the chance to enable life to establish and provide conditions which are unlike those of the external environment. Unicellular organisms show that this is sufficient to be complete as a living system, and multicellular organisms like ourselves are complex co-operations of trillions of units like these.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Metabolism</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Metabolism forms the engine of life. I have devoted much time to learning how living things trap, convert, and use energy. All life, whether in plants or animals, needs energy flowing continuously to sustain it, whether by photosynthesis or cellular respiration, respectively. This is not a passive life, but an active preservation against the thermodynamic law of increasing disorder. As a rule, the metabolism ceases, and life is discontinued after several minutes or hours.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Homeostasis</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of homeostasis is not as appreciated much. Organisms are constantly maintaining their interior environments, including temperature, pH and chemical concentrations at a range despite external changes. Your body temperature tries to stays approximately 37 °C in the deasrt. And it is such a vital regulatory capacity that when it fails, it will most likely cause a rapid demise.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Growth</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Growth and development are based on encrypted instructions, mainly DNA. This continues to astonish me after many years because even a single fertilised egg holds the data and processes of building a whole living being. This is not a random assembly process but a coordinated development, with timing and sequence more important than the components.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Reproduction</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Life develops more life, and the genetic information is transferred to the next generation as a result of asexual or sexual reproduction. This property can be associated with evolution; without reproduction, there is no inheritance, and without inheritance, there is no evolution.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Response to stimuli</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Response to stimuli proves that life is not an isolated phenomenon. Living things detect and respond to their environments in a manner that is more likely to keep them alive. The sunflower that follows the sun, the bacterium that chases food, the prey that is running away - these reactions are manifestations of the integrated systems, which receive information and take action against it.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Evolution </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The long-term strategy of life is evolution and adaptation. Populations evolve during mutation and natural selection between generations, acquiring new abilities and changing depending on the environment. That is why bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics and Darwinian finches possess varying beak forms. It is also why our life has survived almost four billion years despite numerous environmental disasters.  </p>

            <h3 class="blog-title"><p>Beyond Earth: Expanding Our Perspective</p></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">My recent activities in astrobiology have significantly questioned my way of thinking concerning the definition of life. Throughout most of my career, I had been studying carbon-based, water-dependent organisms, the type of which we are familiar with. However, when we extend our exploration to other worlds, we have to question whether our definition is universal or Earth-centric.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Biochemistry based on silicon is still hypothetical, but it is still chemically possible. Silicon is positioned immediately below carbon in the periodic table and can form the same type of bonds with varying stability profiles. Similarly, although water is a fantastic solvent with remarkable characteristics, it is time to start thinking about whether life might work with liquid methane, as may be present in the hydrocarbon lakes of Saturn's moon Titan, or even supercritical carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">These extremophiles on Earth have widened my understanding of possible life. I have read about living things that survive in boiling acidic springs, ice in the Antarctic, kilometres deep in solid rock, and salt levels that would dry up most life forms. Every discovery stretches the limits of our belief. When it is possible to have life in the most extreme environments on Earth, what will we discover in the subsurface ocean of Europa or in the atmosphere of Venus at altitude?</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>The Definition Continues to Evolve</p></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The lesson I have acquired over 20 years is that our definition of life does not stand still, but it changes as we gain more knowledge and broaden our search. The NASA definition is satisfactory, at least at the stage of my career, but it will be polished even further, possibly during my lifetime as a professional. Even the discovery of extraterrestrial life, even microbial, would make us reconsider making assumptions about which we have been unconscious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This hesitation does not bother me as it used to before. Science is not a method to arrive at definitive answers but to pose more and more elaborate questions. Defining life is not as much as delineating a sharp border, but rather the process of knowing the principles that will bring matter to life and make it grow, reproduce and change. Twenty years later, I still find that mystery taking me into the laboratory each morning.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title"><p>Questions for reader</p></h3>


<p style="text-align: justify;">How will you define life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does life follow a pattern or its random?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you think is the purpose of life?</p>
